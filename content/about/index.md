<h1 class="f1 f-headline">My Background</h1>

I have been at Cal Poly since 2017, where I teach R programming, Data Science, and introductory statistics.  I also help run the San Luis Obispo area <a href="https://www.meetup.com/useR-Group-in-San-Luis-Obispo-County/">R Meetup Group</a>.


I grew up in Cupertino, California in a family full of computer scientists.  My undergraduate degree is from Harvard University, where I earned a B.A. in Statistics with minor degrees in English and French.  I wrote my senior thesis under the mentorship of the incomparable <a href='http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~blitz/Site/Home.html'>Professor Joe Blitzstein</a>.  After graduation, I completed a one year research assistantship with <a href='www.probability.ca'>Dr. Jeffrey Rosenthal</a> and <a href='http://www.law.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/full-time-faculty/albert-yoon'>Dr. Albert Yoon</a> at the University of Toronto.<br><br>I received my Ph.D. in Statistics and Operations Research in 2017 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, under the direction of <a href='http://www.unc.edu/~nobel/'>Dr. Andrew B. Nobel</a> and <a href='http://www.unc.edu/~zhangk/'>Dr. Kai Zhang.</a>  My dissertation was titled <a href='https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:de606a1c-f85d-45d5-9767-c5b06063aa29'>Methods of Association Mining by Variable-to-Set Affinity Testing.</a> During my graduate years, I also taught introductory statistics, and served as Senior Resident Tutor for Kirkland House at Harvard University.<br><br>I am an avid fan of the San Jose Sharks, a collector and connoisseur of board games, and a lover of sports and the outdoors.  I travel frequently, for work and for pleasure.  Don't hesitate to contact me if you'd like to talk R and the tidyverse, banter about hockey, challenge me to a board game, recommend a great book, or suggest a new hike in the Central Coast area!<br><br>My current research interests include<h3><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> &nbsp; Software for the Classroom</h3><h3><i class="fas fa-university"></i> &nbsp; Digital Humanities</h3><h3><i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> &nbsp; Clustering, Networks, Recommendation Systems</h3><h3><i class="fas fa-database"></i> &nbsp; High-Dimensional Data</h3><h3><i class="fas fa-file-code"></i> &nbsp; Reproducibility and Code Accountability</h3>
