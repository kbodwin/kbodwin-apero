    The above quote is from the play *Arcadia* by Tom Stoppard, and it captures how I feel about the beauty of examining the world through a statistical lens.
  
  
    Here you'll find an assortment of my thoughts, ideas, and experiments; as well as some tutorials and updates on recent projects.  Don't expect regular updates, but feel free to poke around and see what's on my mind lately.

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
