intro: "<h1> <i class='fas fa-laptop-code'></i>  Contract Work</h1>


Do you have a Data Science project that needs an expert touch?  I am available for short-term contract or consulting work with a focus on statistical analysis, data exploration, and/or dashboard development.


I prefer projects conducted primarily in R, but I have intermediate knowledge of python, SQL, Ruby, and C/C++; and I am happy to interface with these ecosystems.


Rates are negotiable by project and typically billed on a per-project basis rather than hourly. Please <a href='/form/'>contact me</a>, and we can set up a time to discuss scope and cost.


<h1> <i class='fas fa-chalkboard-teacher'></i>  Private Trainings</h1>


If you or your organization are looking to level-up your R and Data Science skills, perhaps the time is right for a private training. This can take the form of an intensive 1-5 day workshop, or a series of short weekly or biweekly  meetings.  Training material can be tailored to the needs and data structures of your projects.


Check out my <a href='/courses/'>course and workshop materials</a> for a sampling of what I can create for you.


<h1> <i class='far fa-calendar-alt'></i>  Drop-in Consulting</h1>

When possible, I set aside time in my schedule for drop-in one-on-one sessions, at a rate of $100/hour.  This option is not recommended for large scale or time sensitive projects, as I cannot guarantee regular availability.  However, it may be useful if you are seeking a review of your statistical analysis or help solving a pesky R challenge.
