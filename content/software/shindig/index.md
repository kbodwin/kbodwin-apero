## [Shindig](https://github.com/r-for-educators/Shindig) is a package to make it easier to convert static code to interactive Shiny output.

### About

This package is still in development.

The goal is to create a set of "shortcut" functions for the common task to converting
basic R code into code for an interactive Shiny app.  With `Shindig`, the user
will not need to write the *server-side* code for the app; they will only need to
specify the appearance and inputs of the user interface.
