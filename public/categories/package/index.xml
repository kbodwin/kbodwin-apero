iris %&amp;gt;%
group_by(Species) %&amp;gt;%
summarize(mean(Sepal.Length))#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2#&amp;gt; Species `mean(Sepal.Length)`#&amp;gt; &amp;lt;fct&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;#&amp;gt; 1 setosa 5.</description>

      <description>Historical ContextIn 1989, the country of Poland underwent a peaceful revolution, replacing its existing Communist government with a Democratically elected one. The culminating moment of this process was a Round Table agreement reached between leaders of the Opposition and Communist groups.
How did this movement build over the decades prior, and how did these two groups come together? Our project aims to quantify the evolution of social network between key individuals and organizations over the years before 1989.</description>

      <description>templar is a package that lets educators auto-generate repetitive course material content from R Markdown source files and yaml headers. AboutThis package is still in development.
The goal is to create a set of templates for course material sets, such as the syllabus, assignments, exams, and labs. Information about each course will be stored in one unified yaml file, so that the materials can be updated each year (or quarter or semester) without having to hunt through each individual file and search for dates and details.</description>
