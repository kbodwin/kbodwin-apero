      <title>Setting up a SQL database with AWS.</title>

      <description>Making a database on AmazonStep 1: Create an AWS account. I did it a long time ago, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty straightforward, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to re-do it here for no reason.
Step 2: Follow Items 1-5 only in this tutorial to create a databaset instance.
Step 3: Make sure you choose the free tier! Select whatever username and password you want - but it&amp;rsquo;s a pain in the butt to add additional users, so if security is not a huge concern and you want your database to be broadly accessible, choose a username and password that you&amp;rsquo;re willing to share.</description>

Paper AbstractGiven data obtained under two sampling conditions, it is often of interest to identify variables that behave differently in one condition than in the other. We introduce a method for differential analysis of second-order behavior called Differential Correlation Mining (DCM). The DCM method identifies differentially correlated sets of variables, with the property that the average pairwise correlation between variables in a set is higher under one sample condition than the other.</description>

      <description>Co-Authors: Carson Mosso, Suman Chakraborty, Andrew Nobel and Kai Zhang
Paper Abstract:We consider the problem of identifying stable sets of mutually associated features in moderate or high-dimensional binary data. In this context we develop and investigate a method called Latent Association Mining for Binary Data (LAMB). The LAMB method is based on a simple threshold model in which the observed binary values represent a random thresholding of a latent continuous vector that may have a complex association structure.</description>

      <description>Co-Authors: Hannah Rempel and Ben Ruttenberg
Paper AbstractParrotfishes are important Caribbean herbivores that are believed to indirectly benefit corals by grazing algae; yet, some species also feed on live coral, which may have direct negative impacts on coral growth and survivorship. Caribbean parrotfishes prey upon multiple coral species but have particularly high rates of predation on Orbicella annulari s, a major framework building coral andan endangered species.</description>

      <description>Co-Authors: Gregory Domber and Kien Nguyen.
Historical ContextIn 1989, the country of Poland underwent a peaceful revolution, replacing its existing Communist government with a Democratically elected one. The culminating moment of this process was a Round Table agreement reached between leaders of the Opposition and Communist groups.
How did this movement build over the decades prior, and how did these two groups come together? Our project aims to quantify the evolution of social network between key individuals and organizations over the years before 1989.</description>

templar is a package that lets educators auto-generate repetitive course material content from R Markdown source files and yaml headers. AboutThis package is still in development.
The goal is to create a set of templates for course material sets, such as the syllabus, assignments, exams, and labs. Information about each course will be stored in one unified yaml file, so that the materials can be updated each year (or quarter or semester) without having to hunt through each individual file and search for dates and details.</description>

      <description>Co-Authors: Jeff Rosenthal and Albert Yoon
Paper Abstract - University of Toronto Law Journal PaperIn contrast to other branches of government, the Supreme Court of Canada operates with relatively lean staffing. For most of the Court’s history, its justices alone determined which cases to review, heard oral argument, and wrote opinions. Only since 1967 have justices have been aided in these responsibilities by law clerks. While interest abounds in the relationship between justices and their clerks – particularly the writing of opinions – very little is known.</description>
