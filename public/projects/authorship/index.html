Paper Abstract - University of Toronto Law Journal PaperIn contrast to other branches of government, the Supreme Court of Canada operates with relatively lean staffing. For most of the Court’s history, its justices alone determined which cases to review, heard oral argument, and wrote opinions. Only since 1967 have justices have been aided in these responsibilities by law clerks. While interest abounds in the relationship between justices and their clerks – particularly the writing of opinions – very little is known.">

<p>In contrast to other branches of government, the Supreme Court of
Canada operates with relatively lean staffing. For most of the Court’s
history, its justices alone determined which cases to review, heard oral
argument, and wrote opinions. Only since 1967 have justices have been
aided in these responsibilities by law clerks. While interest abounds in the
relationship between justices and their clerks – particularly the writing of
opinions – very little is known. This article analyzes the text of the
Court’s opinions to better understand judicial authorship. We find that
justices possess distinct writing styles, allowing us to distinguish them
from one another. Their writing styles also provide insight into how
clerks influence the writing of opinions. Most justices in the modern era
possess a more variable writing style than their predecessors, both within
and across years, providing strong evidence that clerks are increasingly
involved in the writing of judicial opinions.</p>

<p>Legal scholars have long been interested in the extent to which judges rely
on their law clerks in writing judicial opinions. Recent scholarship provides
compelling evidence that Supreme Court justices increasingly rely on their
clerks. Distinguishing between judge-written and clerk-written opinions is difficult, since this information is typically kept within chambers. The opinions
of Judge Frank Easterbrook of the U.S. Court of Appeals provides a unique
opportunity: he writes his own opinions, aside from allowing each of his clerks
to write a first draft of one opinion (typically towards the end of her clerkship).
This article examines linguistic and stylistic elements of Judge Easterbrook’s
opinions to establish analytically the degree of similarity in his writing style
compared to his clerks and fellow 7th Circuit judges. We find that Judge Easterbrook’s opinions are clearly identifiable from those of his fellow jurists. By
contrast, his clerks’ writings are statistically distinct but less identifiable. Our
study supports the view that even with close judicial oversight, clerks’ writing
cannot be made exactly equivalent to their judges. It also provides evidence
for the effectiveness of a clerkship experience such as Judge Easterbrook’s, in
which clerks are given a lengthy opportunity to learn both his stylistic and
substantive approach to the law.</p>
