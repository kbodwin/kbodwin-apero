      <description>Historical ContextIn 1989, the country of Poland underwent a peaceful revolution, replacing its existing Communist government with a Democratically elected one. The culminating moment of this process was a Round Table agreement reached between leaders of the Opposition and Communist groups.
How did this movement build over the decades prior, and how did these two groups come together? Our project aims to quantify the evolution of social network between key individuals and organizations over the years before 1989.</description>
