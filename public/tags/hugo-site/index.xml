      <description>Making a database on AmazonStep 1: Create an AWS account. I did it a long time ago, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty straightforward, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to re-do it here for no reason.
Step 2: Follow Items 1-5 only in this tutorial to create a databaset instance.
Step 3: Make sure you choose the free tier! Select whatever username and password you want - but it&amp;rsquo;s a pain in the butt to add additional users, so if security is not a huge concern and you want your database to be broadly accessible, choose a username and password that you&amp;rsquo;re willing to share.</description>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort. Because SpeedBuilding this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>

      <description>“Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we&amp;rsquo;ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve been making websites.”— Chris House, A Complete Guide to CSS Grid Layout 1
 Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips.</description>

      <description>Formspree makes it easy to receive submissions from HTML forms on your static website. Functional FormThis theme has a form-to-email feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration. All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form (/content/forms/contact.md). Of course, the example shown below (your@email.here) must not be used.</description>
